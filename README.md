# SRE-assignment
***
This is my submission for the SRE Assignment given to me by Credit Suisse. Author: Nur Atsirah Binte Kamsir. The assignment requires to create a script to scrape event logs and 
Perform a data dump into ELK stack. Language used for script: Python 3. Project Status: Completed.

### General Info
***
A python script was developed to scrape event logs to be dumped into ELK. For the purpose of assignment, artificial data is being generated and loaded into ‘logs_Apr_2021.txt’. This can be done by running ‘random_logsgenerator.py’. Logs are in json format with each json object containing 4 fields ie ID/CLIENTID,timestamp,log_level and thread. Generation of this artificial data takes in the assumptions 
1)  timestamp format is of form yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS
2)  2 log levels: ERROR/INFO
3)  each log files, contain logs for that particular Month-Year
 If json object contains ‘CLIENT ID’ field, it is an error index. Else , it is a data index.
For each client ID, an encryption is done to the id before being sent to Elasticsearch. This is done by generating a key. This key is stored in a file in the secretkeys folder. Eg. logs_2021_Apr.txt, refer to 2021_April.key for its corresponding key. Key needs to be kept in a secured folder so that CLIENT ID can be decrypted to its original value in the future.

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* Python 3
* Elasticsearch
## Installation
***
Refer to requirements.txt folder to install all packages needed to run jsondump.py
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Challenges Faced
***
It was a challenging yet rewarding assignment for me because all the concepts tested were fairly new but I had fun learning new concepts.Biggest challenge faced was figuring out how to configure Elasticsearch on my localhost and how to have my python script establish a succesful connection to an Elasticsearch instance. I also had to readup on the syntax used in elasticsearch so that I am able to convert json to an acceptable index format in Elastic.
For the 2nd question, it was slightly confusing as to what a trigger is. However after reading  up on Task Scheduler and how it can be used to run python scripts automatically, it gave me a rough idea on how to answer the 2nd part of the question. My intepretation might be wrong but I gave a thorough explanation of my answers.
